        <p>In order to improve and optimize the requirements
        gathering phase Machine Learning can be used. By collecting
        the user input into a meaningful and useful dataset, the power
        of machine learning, natural language processing, and AI can
        automate and improve the process of determining the direction
        for a software development project and the most desired features
        to focus on.

        <p>Update for Checkpoint 1: A detailed review and update for checkpoint 1 of the project is now available. In this update
            the motivation section was added, the related work section expanded, references added initially with more planned, and 
            the proposed experiment section organized and expanded to better reflect project goals.</p>
